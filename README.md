My version of the Free Code Camp React [challenge](https://www.google.com.ng/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwidprLkpOHYAhVrLsAKHWPXBysQFggjMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freecodecamp.org%2Fchallenges%2Fbuild-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game&usg=AOvVaw1YZKeAr2xbhiKEkBJwTHDB).

## How to play
* Use the arrow keys to navigate the Dungeon.
* Defeat all enemies in each level to move to the next one.
* Defeat the boss in level 5 to win the game.
* Have fun!

Hint: a new weapon is available for each level.
